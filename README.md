- [x] #7: The bar elements' data-date properties should match the order of the provided data.
- [x] #8: The bar elements' data-gdp properties should match the order of the provided data.
- [x] #9: Each bar element's height should accurately represent the data's corresponding GDP.
- [x] #10: The data-date attribute and its corresponding bar element should align with the corresponding value on the x-axis.
- [x] #11: The data-gdp attribute and its corresponding bar element should align with the corresponding value on the y-axis.
